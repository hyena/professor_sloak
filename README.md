===============

This is a silly discord bot written to practice Rust. It was originally written for slack, but they broke their api and discord's is better anyway.

The bot wouldn't be possible without data from the [veekun pokedex]
(https://github.com/veekun/pokedex). Thank you, Eevee!


Usage
-----

 1. Create an API key for your bot and invite it to the desired channels.
 2. `cargo run -- <api-key>`
 3. Type `!pokeme` in discord to meet your new pokesona.


Known Issues
------------

The bot is hardcoded to use English language text.
